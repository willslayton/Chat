Basic goals:
* Use sockets/threading to esablish and handle server/client connection
* Create database structures for User, Channel, Message, etc.
* Custom protocol will provide only the barebones server/client commands needed

Future goals:
* Permissions system determine which Messages and Channels are accessible to Users
* Messages fall off the database after 24 hours, similar to a BBS
